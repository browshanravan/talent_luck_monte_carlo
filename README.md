# Talent Luck (Monte Carlo Simulation)

# Overview

This simple python file demonstrates the role of luck contribution in candidate selection.

In this Monte Carlo simulation, a senario is imagined whereby top 10 candidates from 12000 applicants are selected based on their talent and luck scores. The afformentioned are weighted to varying degrees with talent contribution ranging from 100% to 95%. 

The simulation is simply trying to determine what number of candidates would ave been selcted purely on the basis of their talent score compared to if luck played a part in their selection, with luck contribution ranging from 0% to 5%.

This Monte Carlo simulation was ran 1000 times and the results are plotted.

This was inspired by a youtube channel (Veritasium) video, named `Is Success Luck or Hard Work?`
